# The Virtual Esoteric Toolkit
Built in a dark neon lit room by *Nikodemus of Psykeon*

## Welcome, seeker.
You’ve acquired the Virtual Esoteric Toolkit, a set of 10 stand-alone virtual tools to assist modern occultists and technomancers in their craft. It is built for those who have a foot in code, and a foot in the occult.

This isn't your corp’s sanitized and proprietary software; it’s a raw compilation of the first Python programs I've created when I first tried to speak to the machines. 

No gatekeepers. no grid, No middlemen. Just you and the red glowing code of spiritual liberty and self-direction.

Crafted with a DIY cyberpunk ethos, this toolkit is released under the GLPv3 license, so tinker with it, share it, and evolve it while keeping the Nikodemus of Psykeon spirit burning (see LICENSE for more information).
